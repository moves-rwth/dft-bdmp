# Supplementary material for EDCC 2020

This directory contains additional information about experiments summarized in the EDCC2020 submission.

- [BDMPs.pdf](BDMPs.pdf): This file contains images of the processed BDMPs. BDMPs defined in Figaro files can only be viewed in the [KB3 tool](https://www.edf.fr/en/the-edf-group/world-s-largest-power-company/activities/research-and-development/scientific-communities/simulation-softwares?logiciel=10848). Therefore we dumped screen shots from KB3 in this file for accessibility.
- [EDCC-results-sheet.ods](EDCC-results-sheet.ods): This work sheet contains all experimental results.
- [GreatSPNresults](GreatSPNresults): this directory contains screen dumps of the [GreatSPN](https://github.com/greatspn/SOURCES) tool for each test case in a separate file.
- [PythonScript](PythonScript): Python script used to process Figaro-based BDMP definitions is provided in this directory.
- [TestCases](TestCases): this directory contains Figaro definitions, shell scripts to automate experiments, and YAMS outputs organized as individual directory for each test case.
- [TestCases/BENCHMARK](TestCases/BENCHMARK): this directory contains the timed automaton based properties. We do not manually launch the GreatSPN GUI, instead we use command line to automate the experiments.
- [TestCases/run-all-tests.sh](TestCases/run-all-tests.sh): script to process all test cases.
