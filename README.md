# DFT-BDMP
Transformation from *Boolean Logic Driven Markov Processes (BDMPs)* to *Dynamic Fault Trees (DFTs)*.

Each directory contains one test case.
For example, [00-NPPS](00-NPPS) contains all files related to the Nuclear power plant power supply (NPPS) test case.
[01-OK](01-OK) contains the first BDMP test case.
Details of each BDMP test case are available on the webpage link provided in the pdf draft.
The folder [sensitivity](sensitivity) contains some results about the sensitivity analysis.
The 33 test case results along with their schematics are also provided in [testcase-results.pdf](testcase-results.pdf) for quick view.
