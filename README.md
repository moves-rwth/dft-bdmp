# Boolean Logic Driven Markov Processes (BDMPs)

The repository provides supplementary material for publications about BDMPs and their analysis.

## List of files
- The [PRDC 2019](2019-PRDC) publication presents a transformation from *BDMPs* to *Dynamic Fault Trees (DFTs)*.
- The [SAFECOMP 2020](2020-SAFECOMP) publicaiton presents a compositional semantics of *BDMPs* in terms of Markov automata.
- The [2020-EDCC](2020-EDCC) publication presents a transformation from *BDMPs* to *Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets (GSPNs)*.
- The [2020-Lars-Beckers-Thesis](2020-Lars-Beckers-Masters-Thesis) provides implementation details of BDMP2GSPN approach embedded in Storm. 
- The [2021-DSN](2021-DSN) publication presents Figaro model checker build on top of Storm.
- The [2021-NFM](2021-NFM) publication presents a lazy abstraction approch enabled on a recently developed Figaro model checker.
