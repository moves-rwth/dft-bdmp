This file containes directory structure for NFM submission
Translation/ Script\: contains the script used to translate selected DFTs to BDMPs. As the script has many dependencies, one must configure Storm, and Stormpy to run the translation script.
Translation/ Script\FFORT\GenerateKBI.sh contains the commands used to perform the translation. The corresponding KBI files are available in the same directory, as generated by the translation script.
Iand_cut_sets_and_parameters\: contains the I&AB (prototype) implementation  used to perform I&AB method. Refer to main.py for the starting point. The implementation requires cut sets and reliability parameters. 
KB3TOSCRAM\: Various scripts are required to steer KB3 so that data is preprocessed for the I&AB method. This directory contains those scripts. The cutsets are generated using Scram.
wrapper-for-figaroapi.py this file translates given Figaro model to cpp/hpp files which are then linked with Storm. At present we are linking the Figaro models with storm at compile time however dynamic linking is also under consideration. However, such details are not relevant for the results presented in this paper.
Results\:   This directory contains the models and results generated by approximation.
Notebooks\: contains jupyter notebooks written to automatically generate the graphs from the storm output dumps. Jupyter is required to view these notebooks.

**If any result is missing/lacking, then it can be provided on request.**
