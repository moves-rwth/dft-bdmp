# Supplementary material for PRDC 2019

## Paper
The corresponding paper is titled *Synergizing Reliability Modeling Languages: BDMPs without Repairs and DFTs*.
It is published in the *2019 IEEE 24th Pacific Rim International Symposium on Dependable Computing (PRDC)*
and available under the DOI [10.1109/PRDC47002.2019.00057](https://doi.org/10.1109/PRDC47002.2019.00057).

It presents a transformation from *Boolean Logic Driven Markov Processes (BDMPs)* to *Dynamic Fault Trees (DFTs)*.

## Files
Each directory contains one test case.
For example, [00-NPPS](00-NPPS) contains all files related to the *Nuclear power plant power supply (NPPS)* test case.
[01-OK](01-OK) contains the first BDMP test case.
Details of each BDMP test case are available on the webpage link provided in the pdf draft.

The folder [sensitivity](sensitivity) contains some results about the sensitivity analysis.

The 33 test case results along with their schematics are also provided in [testcase-results.pdf](testcase-results.pdf) for quick view.
